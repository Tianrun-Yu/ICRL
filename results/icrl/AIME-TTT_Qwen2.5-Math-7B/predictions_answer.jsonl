When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.\n\nbad answer reward=0{\nTo solve the problem  we need to determine the value of    s     Aya s walking speed in kilometers per hour  and then us\nThe core reasoning of the answer is that the probability of an event occurring is equal to the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
