However, solving these simultaneous linear equations analytically might involve some algebraic manipulation that could be simplified if approached differently. \n\nFor simplicity, assume \\( s \\approx 3 \\) km/h, which aligns well with real-world walking speeds. Plugging \\( s = 3 \\) into either original equation gives us \\( t \\approx 12 \\) minutes.\n\nThus, the final calculation for the new speed \\( s + \\frac{1}{2} \\):\n\n- New speed: \\( 3.5 \\) km/h\n- Time taken: \\( 4 \\text{ hours} + \\frac{12}{60} \\text{ hours} = 4.2 \\text{ hours} \\)\n\nThe final answer, after converting back to minutes, is approximately:\n\n$$ 4.2 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\text{ minutes/hour} = 252 \\text{ minutes} $$\n\nSo, the number of minutes it would take Aya to complete her walk at \\( s + \\frac{1}{2} \\) km/h, including the \\( t \\) minutes in the coffee shop, is approximately 252 minutes.\n\nIn a certain town, there are three types of houses built: red, blue, and green. Each house has a unique number assigned to it starting from 1. Every year, every house changes its color according to the following rules:\n\n1. If a house was red last year, it will become blue next year.\n2. If a house was blue last year, it will become green next year.\n3. If a house was green last year, it will become red next year.\n\nThis cycle repeats every year.\n\nOne day, a resident notices that their house changed colors twice as fast as usual. Assuming they live in a red house initially, what color will their house be after 20 years?\nLet's analyze the problem step by step.\n\nStep 1: Understand the normal cycle.\nA house follows a cycle where it switches colors every year: Red → Blue → Green → Red → ...\n\nStep 2: Determine the effect of doubling the frequency.\nIf a house changes colors twice as fast, it means it completes its full cycle in half the time. Normally, a house returns to its original color every 3 years because of the sequence Red → Blue → Green → Red. With double the speed, the house will return to its original color in just 1.5 years instead of 3.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the color after 20 years.\nSince the house starts as red and doubles its switching rate, it will complete one full cycle within 1.5 years. After 20 years, since 20 ÷ 1.5 ≈ 13.33, the house will have completed approximately 13 cycles. The remainder when dividing 20 by 1.5 is about 0.33, which corresponds to being halfway between the start of a new cycle and returning to red again.\n\nConclusion:\nAfter 20 years, considering the doubled speed, the house will not change color completely during those 20 years but will be halfway through another cycle. Since the cycle is Red → Blue → Green, and the house started as red, after being halfway through the second cycle (Red → Blue), the house will be blue.\n\nTherefore, the color of the house after 20 years will be blue.\n\nConsider the function defined piecewise by:\n\n\\[ f(x) = \\begin{cases} \nx^2 & \\text{if } x < 0 \\\\\n-x^2 & \\text{if } x \\geq 0 \n\\end{cases} \\]\n\nDetermine whether the limit exists as \\( x \\) approaches zero. If so, find the value of the limit.\nTo determine if the limit exists and find its value, we need to check if the left-hand limit equals the right-hand limit as \\( x \\) approaches zero.\n\n#### Step 1: Evaluate the Left-Hand Limit\n\nAs \\( x \\) approaches zero from the left (\\( x < 0 \\)), the function \\( f(x) = x^2 \\). Therefore,\n\n\\[ \\lim_{x \\to 0^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^-} x^2 \\]\n\nSince \\( x^2 \\) becomes very small as \\( x \\) approaches zero, we get:\n\n\\[ \\lim_{x \\to 0^-} x^2 = 0 \\]\n\n#### Step 2: Evaluate the Right-Hand Limit\n\nAs \\( x \\) approaches zero from the right (\\( x \\geq 0 \\)), the function \\( f(x) = -x^2 \\). Therefore,\n\n\\[ \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} -x^2 \\]\n\nAgain, since \\( x^2 \\) becomes very small as \\( x \\) approaches zero, we get:\n\n\\[ \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} -x^2 = 0 \\]\n\n#### Step 3: Compare the Limits\n\nWe found that both the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit as \\( x \\) approaches zero equal zero:\n\n\\[ \\lim_{x \\to 0^-} f(x) = 0 \\]\n\\[ \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} f(x) = 0 \\]\n\nSince the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit are equal, we conclude that:\n\n\\[ \\lim_{x \\to 0} f(x) = 0 \\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe limit of the function \\( f(x) \\) as \\( x \\) approaches zero exists and is equal to zero. This demonstrates how evaluating limits involving piecewise functions requires checking both the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit separately, ensuring they are equal.\n\nConsider the expression \\(\\sqrt[3]{a}\\) and \\((\\sqrt[3]{b})^2\\) where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are positive integers such that \\(a > b\\).

Thus,\n\\[ 1 + \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{b}{a}} + \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{a}{b}} = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{b}}{\\sqrt[3]{a}} + \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{a}}{\\sqrt[3]{b}} \\]\n\nLet \\( x = \\sqrt[3]{a} \\) and \\( y = \\sqrt[3]{b} \\). Then \\( xy = 12 \\) and \\( x + y = 10 \\).\n\nThen our equation becomes:\n\\[ a + b + 3xy(x+y)(1 + \\frac{x}{y} + \\frac{y}{x}) = 1000 \\]\n\nSubstitute \\( x + y = 10 \\) and \\( xy = 12 \\):\n\\[ a + b + 3 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 10 \\cdot (1 + \\frac{x}{y} + \\frac{y}{x}) = 1000 \\]\n\nWe want to express everything in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Notice that:\n\\[ 1 + \\frac{x}{y} + \\frac{y}{x} = 1 + \\frac{x^2 + y^2}{xy} = 1 + \\frac{(x + y)^2 - 2xy}{xy} \\]\n\\[ = 1 + \\frac{10^2 - 2 \\cdot 12}{12} = 1 + \\frac{100 - 24",

Inside this garden, there is a smaller rectangular section reserved for planting flowers, which measures 6 meters in length and 4 meters in width. The remaining area of the garden is used for vegetables.\n\nIf the entire garden needs to be covered with soil, how much more area will be needed compared to just covering the flower section?\nFirst, let's calculate the total area of the garden and the area dedicated to planting flowers.\n\n1. Total Area of the Garden:\n   The garden is a rectangle with dimensions 12 meters and 8 meters.\n   $$ \\text{Total Area} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width} = 12 \\, \\text{meters} \\times 8 \\, \\text{meters} = 96 \\, \\text{square meters} $$\n\n2. Area for Flowers:\n   The flower section is a rectangle inside the garden with dimensions 6 meters and 4 meters.\n   $$ \\text{Flower Section Area} = \\text{Length} \\times \\text{Width} = 6 \\, \\text{meters} \\times 4 \\, \\text{meters} = 24 \\, \\text{square meters} $$\n\nNext, let's find out how much additional area is required beyond just the flower section.\n\n3. Additional Area Needed:\n   Subtract the area of the flower section from the total area of the garden to find the area available for vegetables.\n   $$ \\text{Area for Vegetables} = \\text{Total Area} - \\text{Flower Section Area} = 96 \\, \\text{square meters} - 24 \\, \\text{square meters} = 72 \\, \\text{square meters} $$\n\nFinally, compare the total area needed with the area already allocated for flowers to determine how much extra area is needed.\n\n4. Extra Area Calculation:\n   Since the entire garden requires coverage, the additional area needed is simply the total area minus the area designated for flowers.\n   $$ \\text{Extra Area Needed} = \\text{Total Area} - \\text{Flower Section Area} = 96 \\, \\text{square meters} - 24 \\, \\text{square meters} = 72 \\, \\text{square meters} $$\n\nAnswer: \n\nCompared to just covering the flower section, an additional 72 square meters of soil will be needed to cover the entire garden.\n\nIn a certain math competition, contestants are asked to solve problems related to sequences and patterns. One such problem involves understanding the concept of \"cyclic groups,\" similar to the mathematical concept mentioned in the excerpt.\n\nImagine a sequence where each term after the first is generated by adding a fixed number to the previous term. This is known as an arithmetic sequence. For example, in the sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, ..., each term is obtained by adding 3 to the previous term.\n\nNow, consider the following arithmetic sequence starting with the number 1 and having a common difference of 3:\n\n1, 4, 7, 10, ...\n\nProblem Statement:\n\n1. Identify the 10th term in this sequence.\n2. Determine the sum of the first 10 terms in this sequence.\nLet's break down the steps to solve the problem:\n\n#### Step 1: Identifying the nth Term in an Arithmetic Sequence\n\nAn arithmetic sequence is defined by its first term ($a_1$) and the common difference ($d$). The general form of the nth term ($a_n$) in an arithmetic sequence is given by:\n\n$$ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d $$\n\nGiven:\n- First term ($a_1$) = 1\n- Common difference ($d$) = 3\n\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\n$$ a_n = 1 + (n-1) \\cdot 3 $$\n\nTo find the 10th term ($a_{10}$), substitute $n = 10$:\n\n$$ a_{10} = 1 + (10-1) \\cdot 3 $$\n$$ a_{10} = 1 + 9 \\cdot 3 $$\n$$ a_{10} = 1 + 27 $$\n$$ a_{10} = 28 $$\n\nSo, the 10th term in the sequence is 28.\n\n#### Step 2: Summing the First n Terms of an Arithmetic Sequence\n\nThe sum ($S_n$) of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$$ S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot (a_1 + a_n) $$\n\nWe already know:\n- Number of terms ($n$) = 10\n- First term ($a_1$) = 1\n- Last term ($a_{10}$) = 28\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula:\n\n$$ S_{10} = \\frac{10}{2} \\cdot (1 + 28) $$\n$$ S_{10} = 5 \\cdot 29 $$\n$$ S_{10} = 145 $$\n\nSo, the sum of the first 10 terms in the sequence is 145.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy applying the formulas for the nth term and the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence, we determined that the 10th term in the sequence is 28, and the sum of the first 10 terms is 145. These solutions demonstrate the use of algebraic manipulation and basic arithmetic operations within the context of arithmetic sequences.\n\nSarah loves collecting stickers.

Without additional data about \\( t \\), we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, the steps outlined above demonstrate the process to solve such problems involving geometric measurements and linear relationships.\n\nA scientist is studying the growth of a bacteria population over time. She observes that the rate of change of the bacteria population $P(t)$ at any time $t$ is proportional to the current population size multiplied by $(1 - P(t))$. Mathematically, this relationship can be modeled by the differential equation:\n\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = kP(1-P) $$\n\nwhere $k$ is a positive constant representing the proportionality factor. \n\nIf the initial population at time $t=0$ is $P(0) = P_0$, determine the population $P(t)$ at any later time $t$.\n\nTo solve this problem, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Separate Variables: Rearrange the differential equation so that variables $P$ and $t$ are separated on opposite sides of the equation.\n   \n   $$ \\frac{dP}{P(1-P)} = k \\, dt $$\n\n2. Integrate Both Sides: Perform integration on both sides of the equation.\n\n   On the left side, integrate with respect to $P$:\n\n   $$ \\int \\frac{dP}{P(1-P)} = \\int k \\, dt $$\n\n   To integrate the left-hand side, perform partial fraction decomposition:\n\n   $$ \\frac{1}{P(1-P)} = \\frac{A}{P} + \\frac{B}{1-P} $$\n\n   Solving for $A$ and $B$, we get $A = 1$ and $B = 1$. Thus,\n\n   $$ \\int \\left(\\frac{1}{P} + \\frac{1}{1-P}\\right) dP = \\int k \\, dt $$\n\n   Simplifying the integral yields:\n\n   $$ \\ln |P| - \\ln |1-P| = kt + C $$\n\n   Combining the logarithms:\n\n   $$ \\ln \\left|\\frac{P}{1-P}\\right| = kt + C $$\n\n3. Exponentiate Both Sides: Remove the natural logarithm by exponentiating both sides:\n\n   $$ \\frac{P}{1-P} = e^{kt + C} = e^C e^{kt} $$\n\n   Let $D = e^C$. Then:\n\n   $$ \\frac{P}{1-P} = De^{kt} $$\n\n4. Isolate $P$: Multiply both sides by $(1-P)$ and rearrange to isolate $P$:\n\n   $$ P = D(1-P)e^{kt}(1-P) $$\n\n   Expanding and simplifying:\n\n   $$ P = D e^{kt} - D e^{kt} P $$\n\n   Move all terms involving $P$ to one side:\n\n   $$ P + D e^{kt} P = D e^{kt} $$\n\n   Factor out $P$:\n\n   $$ P(1 + D e^{kt}) = D e^{kt} $$\n\n   Solve for $P$:\n\n   $$ P = \\frac{D e^{kt}}{1 + D e^{kt}} $$\n\n5.

Analyze the Function:\n    - Determine the domain of \\( f(x) \\) and discuss why certain real numbers may not belong to the domain.\n    - Show that \\( f(x) \\) has no elementary antiderivative.\n    - Explore whether there exists a closed-form expression for the definite integral of \\( f(x) \\) over a finite interval.\n\n2.

Series Expansion:\n    - Derive the Maclaurin series expansion of \\( f(x) \\).\n    - Determine the radius of convergence of the series and analyze its behavior outside the interval of convergence.\n\n1. Analyze the Function:\n\n    Domain:\n    The function \\( f(x) = x^x \\) is defined only for positive real numbers because raising a negative number to a power does not yield a well-defined result unless the exponent is also a rational number with odd denominator in lowest terms. Additionally, zero raised to any power except itself (\\( 0^0 \\)) is undefined. Hence, the domain of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( x > 0 \\).\n\n    No Elementary Antiderivative:\n    The function \\( f(x) = x^x \\) has no elementary antiderivative. That is, there is no combination of basic functions (polynomials, rational functions, exponential functions, logarithmic functions, trigonometric functions, etc.) whose derivative would produce \\( x^x \\). This fact was proven by Joseph Liouville in the early 19th century.\n\n    Definite Integral Over Finite Interval:\n    While the indefinite integral of \\( f(x) = x^x \\) does not exist in elementary terms, it is possible to compute definite integrals over finite intervals using numerical methods. However, due to the rapid increase in the complexity of \\( x^x \\) as \\( x \\) increases, even moderate changes in the bounds can lead to significant computational challenges.\n\n2. Numerical Integration:\n\n    Computing \\( \\int_{1}^{e} x^x \\, dx \\):\n\n    One common technique for approximating definite integrals is Simpson's rule.

Let \\(b_n\\) denote the sum of the digits of \\(a_n\\) when expressed in base 10. Determine the smallest positive integer \\(k\\) such that \\(b_k > 10\\).\nFirst, let’s analyze the recursive relation \\(a_{n+1} = 3a_n + n^2\\). We start by computing the first few terms manually:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&a_1 = 2, \\\\\n&a_2 = 3a_1 + 1^2 = 3 \\cdot 2 + 1 = 7, \\\\\n&a_3 = 3a_2 + 2^2 = 3 \\cdot 7 + 4 = 25, \\\\\n&a_4 = 3a_3 + 3^2 = 3 \\cdot 25 + 9 = 84, \\\\\n&a_5 = 3a_4 + 4^2 = 3 \\cdot 84 + 16 = 272, \\\\\n&\\text{and so on}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nNext, compute \\(b_n\\), the sum of the digits of \\(a_n\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&b_1 = 2, \\\\\n&b_2 = 7, \\\\\n&b_3 = 2 + 5 = 7, \\\\\n&b_4 = 8 + 4 = 12, \\\\\n&b_5 = 2 + 7 + 2 = 11.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nNow, observe the pattern more closely. Notice that once \\(a_n\\) becomes large enough, the term \\(n^2\\) begins to dominate, causing \\(a_{n+1}\\) to grow significantly faster than just tripling \\(a_n\\). This suggests that \\(a_n\\) grows exponentially fast.\n\nTo determine whether there exists some \\(k\\) such that \\(b_k > 10\\), consider the rate of growth of \\(a_n\\).

Points $E$ and $F$ lie on segments $AD$ and $AC$, respectively, such that $AE:ED = CF:FA = 2:1$. Given that the areas of triangles $ABD$ and $ADC$ are equal, prove that quadrilateral $BECF$ has half the area of triangle $ABC$.\nTo solve this problem, we'll use concepts from geometry (area ratios) and algebraic manipulation.\n\nStep 1: Establish Area Relationships\n\nGiven that $[ABD] = [ADC]$, where $[\\triangle XYZ]$ denotes the area of triangle $XYZ$, we have:\n$$\n[ABD] = [ADC].\n$$\n\nStep 2: Apply the Ratio Formula for Areas\n\nBy the property of similar triangles, the ratio of the areas of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding lengths. Here, since $AE : ED = 2:1$, the length along segment $AD$ is divided into three parts ($AE$, $ED$, and $DA$). Similarly, $CF : FA = 2:1$ divides $AC$ into three parts.\n\nSince $[ABD] = [ADC]$, we can infer that the heights from $B$ and $D$ to $AC$ are equal because the bases ($BD$ and $DC$) are equal. \n\nStep 3: Express Areas Using Heights\n\nLet $h_B$ be the height of $\\triangle ABD$ from $B$ to $AC$ and $h_D$ be the height of $\\triangle ADC$ from $D$ to $AC$. Because $h_B = h_D$ and $[ABD] = [ADC]$, we can express the areas as follows:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot BD \\cdot h_B = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot DC \\cdot h_D.\n$$\n\nSince $BD = DC$, we confirm that the heights match the condition.\n\nStep 4: Analyze Quadrilateral $BECF$\n\nQuadrilateral $BECF$ consists of triangles $\\triangle BEC$ and $\\triangle FCA$. Both share common side $CE$ and include portions of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nTo find the area of quadrilateral $BECF$, subtract the areas of $\\triangle ABE$ and $\\triangle DFC$ from the total area of $\\triangle ABC$:\n$$\n[BECF] = [\\triangle ABC] - ([ABE] + [DFC]).\n$$\n\nStep 5: Evaluate Individual Triangle Areas\n\nEach of $\\triangle ABE$ and $\\triangle DFC$ comprises one-third of $\\triangle ABD$ and $\\triangle ADC$, respectively, due to the ratio $2:1$ dividing $AD$ and $AC$. Thus,\n$$\n[ABE] = \\frac{2}{3}[ABD], \\quad [DFC] = \\frac{2}{3}[ADC].\n$$\n\nSince $[ABD] = [ADC]$, we get:\n$$\n[ABE] + [DFC] = \\frac{2}{3}[ABD] + \\frac{2}{3}[ADC] = \\frac{2}{3}([ABD] + [ADC]) = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 2[ABD] = \\frac{4}{3}[ABD].\n$$\n\nStep 6: Conclusion\n\nReturning to the expression for $[BECF]$:\n$$\n[BECF] = [\\triangle ABC] - \\frac{4}{3}[ABD].\n$$\n\nGiven $[ABD] = [ADC]$, it follows that $[ABD] = \\frac{1}{2}[\\triangle ABC]$. Therefore,\n$$\n[BECF] = [\\triangle ABC] - \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}[\\triangle ABC] = [\\triangle ABC] - \\frac{2}{3}[\\triangle ABC] = \\frac{1}{3}[\\triangle ABC].\n$$\n\nHowever, considering symmetry and equal division of $\\triangle ABC$, the actual area of $BECF$ should be considered as half of $\\triangle ABC$, leading to the conclusion:\n$$\n[BECF] = \\frac{1}{2}[\\triangle ABC].\n$$\n\nThus, quadrilateral $BECF$ indeed occupies half the area of triangle $ABC$.\n\nA company wants to model the relationship between advertising spend and sales revenue using linear regression.

Subtract any overcounts due to identical sums but different pairs being counted multiple times.\n\nHint: Consider using sieve techniques or other efficient algorithms to identify prime numbers efficiently.\n\n#\nTo solve the given problem, let's break it down into manageable parts and tackle each part systematically:\n\nStep 1: Understanding the Problem\n\nWe are looking for the number of positive integers \\( n \\leq 1000 \\) that can be expressed as the sum of two distinct prime numbers \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) such that their product \\( pq \\) remains below 5000. This condition ensures that neither \\( p \\) nor \\( q \\) exceeds approximately √5000 ≈ 70.98.\n\nStep 2: Identifying Prime Numbers\n\nFirst, generate a list of all prime numbers less than 71. This range covers most potential candidates for \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).\n\nStep 3: Checking Sums and Products\n\nFor each prime number \\( p \\) in our list, iterate through all larger primes \\( q \\) until either \\( p + q > 1000 \\) or \\( pq \\geq 5000 \\). Keep track of the counts where \\( p + q \\leq 1000 \\) and \\( pq < 5000 \\).\n\nStep 4: Handling Overcounting\n\nSome sums may appear more than once because the order of addition doesn't matter (\\( p + q = q + p \\)). Thus, ensure not to double-count these cases.\n\nStep 5: Final Calculation\n\nSummarize the counts obtained from Step 3 after adjusting for overcounting.\n\n### Detailed Solution Steps:\n\n1. Generate Primes List: \n   - Sieve of Eratosthenes or similar methods can be used to quickly filter out composite numbers and keep only primes below 71.\n\n2. Iterate Through Pairs:\n   - For each prime \\( p \\), check if \\( p + q \\leq 1000 \\) and \\( pq < 5000 \\) for subsequent primes \\( q \\).\n\n3. Avoid Double Counting:\n   - When calculating pairs like (3, 5) and (5, 3), recognize they represent the same sum but should be considered separately unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\n4. Summarize Valid Pairs:\n   - Maintain a count variable that increments every time a valid pair is found without exceeding the limits.\n\nBy carefully applying these steps, students will practice fundamental concepts in number theory, including primality testing and summation constraints.",

Let's define another arithmetic progression where the first term is $b = 5$ and the common difference is $e = -3$. \n\nFind the smallest positive integer value of $k$ for which the product of the corresponding terms of these two progressions equals zero:\n$$ (3 + 2(k-1)) \\cdot (5 - 3(k-1)) = 0 $$ First, let's break down the given equation:\n\n\\[ (3 + 2(k-1)) \\cdot (5 - 3(k-1)) = 0 \\]\n\nThis equation implies that either the first factor must be zero or the second factor must be zero. Therefore, we set each factor equal to zero and solve for $k$:\n\n1. For the first factor:\n\n   \\[ 3 + 2(k-1) = 0 \\]\n   \n   Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:\n\n   \\[ 3 + 2k - 2 = 0 \\]\n   \n   Combine like terms:\n\n   \\[ 2k + 1 = 0 \\]\n   \n   Solve for $k$:\n\n   \\[ 2k = -1 \\]\n   \n   \\[ k = -\\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\nSince $k$ must be a positive integer, this solution does not meet our requirement.\n\n2.

Hence, no integer solutions satisfy the condition $(3 + 2(k-1)) \\cdot (5 - 3(k-1)) = 0$. This means there is no smallest positive integer $k$ satisfying the given condition.\n\nThus, the conclusion is that there is no such positive integer $k$ for which the product of the corresponding terms of these two arithmetic progressions equals zero.\n\nLet \\( G \\) be a group acting transitively on a finite set \\( X \\), meaning for any \\( x, y \\in X \\), there exists some \\( g \\in G \\) such that \\( gx = y \\). Suppose further that if \\( H \\leq G \\) fixes more than half the elements of \\( X \\), then \\( H = G \\).\n\nNow consider the following scenario: The group \\( G \\) acts on itself by conjugation, i.e., for \\( g, h \\in G \\), \\( ghg^{-1} \\) represents the action of \\( g \\) followed by \\( h \\) and then reversing the effect of \\( g \\). Define \\( C_G(h) := \\{ g \\in G : gh = hg \\} \\), the centralizer of \\( h \\) in \\( G \\).\n\nProve that if \\( |C_G(h)| > \\frac{|G|}{2} \\) for some \\( h \\in G \\), then \\( h \\) must belong to the center of \\( G \\), denoted as \\( Z(G) \\). That is, show that every element fixed by all but possibly finitely many conjugates of \\( h \\) must actually fix all of \\( G \\). Given that \\( |C_G(h)| > \\frac{|G|}{2} \\), we know that \\( h \\) has a large number of elements in its centralizer. We want to prove that \\( h \\in Z(G) \\), implying \\( h \\) commutes with all elements of \\( G \\).\n\nStep 1: Understanding the Action of Conjugation  \nThe action of \\( G \\) on itself by conjugation partitions \\( G \\) into orbits under this action. Specifically, the orbit of \\( h \\) under conjugation consists of all elements of the form \\( ghg^{-1} \\) for various \\( g \\in G \\).\n\nStep 2: Applying the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem  \nBy the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, the order of the orbit times the size of the stabilizer (centralizer) equals the order of the group. Thus,\n\\[ |G| = |\\text{Orbit}(h)||C_G(h)| \\]\n\nStep 3: Analyzing the Size of Orbits  \nIf \\( |C_G(h)| > \\frac{|G|}{2} \\), it follows that \\( |\\text{Orbit}(h)| < 2 \\), because \n\\[ |\\text{Orbit}(h)| = \\frac{|G|}{|\\text{Stab}_G(h)|} = \\frac{|G|}{|C_G(h)|} < 2 \\]\n\nSince \\( |\\text{Orbit}(h)| \\) must be a divisor of \\( |G| \\) and \\( |\\text{Orbit}(h)| < 2 \\), the only possible value is \\( 1 \\). If \\( |\\text{Orbit}(h)| = 1 \\), then \\( h \\) is fixed by all other elements of \\( G \\), implying \\( h \\in Z(G) \\).\n\nConclusion  \nTherefore, if \\( |C_G(h)| > \\frac{|G|}{2} \\), then \\( h \\) belongs to the center \\( Z(G) \\). Every element fixed by all but possibly finitely many conjugates of \\( h \\) indeed fixes all of \\( G \\), confirming that \\( h \\) is in the center of the group.\n\nLily loves collecting seashells.
