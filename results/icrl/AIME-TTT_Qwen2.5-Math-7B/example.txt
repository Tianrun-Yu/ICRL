Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.

1. Use the formula \( \text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \) to set up two equations based on the information provided:

good ideas (reward 1):
- To summarize the core reasoning of the solution:

1. **Convert Times to Hours**: Convert the given times (4 hours and 2 hours and 24 minutes) into hours for easier calculations.
2. **Set Up Equations**:

ANSWER:
Use the relationship between distance, rate, and time to create two equations:
   - For walking at speed \( s \): 
     $$ 9 = s \times 4 + t $$
   - For walking at speed \( s + 2 \):
     $$ 9 = (s + 2) \times \left(\frac{12}{5}\right) + t $$
3. **Solve System of Equations**: Solve this system of linear equations to find the values of \( s \) and \( t \).
4. **Calculate New Time**: Using the new speed \( s + \frac{1}{2} \), calculate how long it will take Aya's walk plus the time spent in the coffee shop.

The detailed steps involve algebraic manipulation and solving systems of equations, which are foundational skills in high school mathematics.
