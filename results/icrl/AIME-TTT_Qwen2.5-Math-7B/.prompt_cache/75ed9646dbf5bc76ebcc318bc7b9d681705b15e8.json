{"prompt": "You are an AI mathematician.  Below are compressed solution ideas from previous attempts; each idea is marked with reward 1 (correct) or 0 (incorrect).  Use the question and these ideas to reason out the correct numeric answer.  **Respond with exactly one number**.\n\nThere exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\\log_x\\left(y^x\\right)=\\log_y\\left(x^{4y}\\right)=10$. Find $xy$.\n\n好的回答reward=1{\n<BLANK‑SUMMARY>\n}"}
