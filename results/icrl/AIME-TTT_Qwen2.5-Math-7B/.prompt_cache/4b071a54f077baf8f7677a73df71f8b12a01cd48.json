{"prompt": "You are an AI mathematician. The token 'reward' that follows each previous answer is 1 if that answer is judged correct, otherwise 0. Using the question together with the previous answers and their rewards, reason out the correct answer. Absolutely **do not** output ANY programming code or code blocks. Finish with exactly one number; that number is the answer.\n\nThere exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\\log_x\\left(y^x\\right)=\\log_y\\left(x^{4y}\\right)=10$. Find $xy$.\n\n### Round 1\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the values of \\(x\\) and\n– reward 1\n\n### Round 2\n– reward 0\n– reward 1\n– reward 0\n– reward 1"}
