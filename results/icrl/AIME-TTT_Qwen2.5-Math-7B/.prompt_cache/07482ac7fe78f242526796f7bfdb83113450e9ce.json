When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.\n\n### Round 1\nâ€“ reward 1- To solve this problem, we need to find the values of \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) first. Let's break it down into manageable steps.\n\n1. **Determine the time spent walking**:\n   - When Aya walks at \\(s\\) km/h, the total time (including the coffee shop) is 4 hours. The time spent walking is \\(4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\) hours.\n   - When Aya walks at \\(s+2\\) km/h, the total time (including the coffee shop) is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours. The time spent walking is \\(2.4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\) hours.\n\n2. **Set up the equations**:\n   - For the first scenario, the walking time is \\(\\frac{9}{s}\\) hours, so we have \\(\\frac{9}{s} = 4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\).\n   - For the second scenario, the walking time is \\(\\frac{9}{s+2}\\) hours, so we have \\(\\frac{9}{s+2} = 2.4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\).\n\n3. **Solve the system of equations**:\n   - From the first equation: \\(\\frac{9}{s} = 4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\).\n   - From the second equation: \\(\\frac{9}{s+2} = 2.4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\).\n\n4. **Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \\(t\\)**:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{s} - \\frac{9}{s+2} = 1.6\n   \\]\n   Simplify the left side:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9(s+2) - 9s}{s(s+2)} = \\frac{18}{s(s+2)} = 1.6\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   18 = 1.6s(s+2)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   18 = 1.6s^2 + 3.2s\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1.6s^2 + 3.2s - 18 = 0\n   \\]\n   Divide the equation by 1.6:\n   \\[\n   s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0\n   \\]\n   Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\(s = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 2\\), and \\(c = -11.25\\):\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{49}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 7}{2}\n   \\]\n   The positive solution is \\(s = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\\).\n\n5. **Find \\(t\\)**:\n   Substitute \\(s = 2.5\\) into the first equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{2.5} = 4 - \\frac{t}{60}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3.6 = 4 - \\frac{t}{60}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{t}{60} = 0.4\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   t = 24\n   \\]\n\n6. **Find the time for \\(s + \\frac{1}{2} = 3\\)**:\n   The walking time is \\(\\frac{9}{3} = 3\\) hours. Including the coffee shop time, the total time is \\(3 + \\frac{24}{60} = 3.4\\) hours, which is 204 minutes.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{204}\\).
