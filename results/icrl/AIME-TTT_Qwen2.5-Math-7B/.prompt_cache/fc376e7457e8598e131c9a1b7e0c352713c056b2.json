{"prompt": "You are an AI mathematician. All content you output **must be in English**.\nBelow are compressed solution ideas from previous attempts; each idea is tagged with reward 1 (correct) or reward 0 (incorrect). Use the question and these ideas to deduce the correct numeric answer. Do **not** show any code or non‑English text. Respond with exactly one number.\n\nThere exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\\log_x\\left(y^x\\right)=\\log_y\\left(x^{4y}\\right)=10$. Find $xy$.\n\nbad answer reward=0{\n}\ngood answer reward=1{\nTo solve the given problem we need to find the values of x and y that satisfy the equations log…\nThe core reasoning of the answer is that the probability of a certain event occurring is determined by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes. This is a fundamental principle in probability theory and is used to calculate the likelihood of various events in a wide range of contexts.\n}"}
