{"prompt": "You are an AI mathematician. All content you output MUST be in English.\nBelow are compressed solution ideas from previous attempts; each idea is tagged with reward 1 (correct) or reward 0 (incorrect). Use the question and these ideas to deduce the correct numeric answer. Do NOT output code or nonâ€‘English text.\n**Finish all your reasoning, then on a NEW line output exactly one number (the answer) and nothing else.**\n\nThere exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\\log_x\\left(y^x\\right)=\\log_y\\left(x^{4y}\\right)=10$. Find $xy$.\n\nbad answer reward=0{\nThe core reasoning of the answer is that the probability of an event occurring is equal to the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
