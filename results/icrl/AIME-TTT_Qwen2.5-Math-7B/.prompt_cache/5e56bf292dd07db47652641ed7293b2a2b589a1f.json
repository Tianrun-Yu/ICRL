{"prompt": "You are an AI mathematician. The token 'reward' that follows each previous answer is 1 if that answer is judged correct, otherwise 0. Using the question together with the previous answers and their rewards, reason out the correct answer. Absolutely **do not** output ANY programming code or code blocks. For ease of verification, finish your response with exactly one number; that number is the answer to the problem. Use this information to improve subsequent answers.\n\nThere exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\\log_x\\left(y^x\\right)=\\log_y\\left(x^{4y}\\right)=10$. Find $xy$.\n\n### Round 1\nâ€“ reward 0\nTo solve the given problem, we start by analyzing the given equations:\n\n1. \\(\\log_x(y^x) = 10\\)\n2. \\(\\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\\)\n\nFirst, let's simplify each equation using properties of logarithms."}
