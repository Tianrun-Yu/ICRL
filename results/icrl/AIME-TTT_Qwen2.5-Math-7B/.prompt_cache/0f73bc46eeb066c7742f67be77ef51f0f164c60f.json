{"prompt": "You are an AI mathematician. The token 'reward' that follows each previous answer is 1 if that answer is judged correct, otherwise 0. Using the question together with the previous answers and their rewards, reason out the correct answer. For ease of verification, make sure the final number that appears in your response is the answer to the problem. Use this information to improve subsequent answers.\n\nThere exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\\log_x\\left(y^x\\right)=\\log_y\\left(x^{4y}\\right)=10$.
