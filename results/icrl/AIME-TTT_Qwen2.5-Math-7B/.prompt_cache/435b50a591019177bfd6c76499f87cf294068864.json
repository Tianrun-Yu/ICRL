Finish with exactly one number; that number is the answer.\n\nEvery morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.\n\n### Round 1\n– reward 0\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the value of \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) using the given information, and then use these values to find the time it takes for Aya to walk 9 kilometers at a speed of \\(s + \\frac{1}{2}\\) kilometers per hour, including the \\(t\\) minutes spent in the coffee shop.\n\nLet's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Determine the walking time without the coffee shop:**\n   - When Aya walks at \\(s\\) km/h, the walk takes 4 hours including \\(t\\) minutes in the coffee shop. So, the walking time is \\(4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\) hours.\n   - When Aya walks at \\(s + 2\\) km/h, the walk takes 2 hours and 24 minutes including \\(t\\) minutes in the coffee shop. So, the walking time is \\(2 + \\frac{24}{60} - \\frac{t}{60} = 2.4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\) hours.\n\n2. **Set up the equations:**\n   - The distance walked is 9 km, so we can set up the following equations:\n     \\[\n     9 = s \\left(4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\right)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     9 = (s + 2) \\left(2.4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\right)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve the equations to find \\(s\\) and \\(t\\):**\n   - From the first equation:\n     \\[\n     9 = 4s - \\frac{st}{60}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     540 = 240s - st\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     st = 240s - 540 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n     \\]\n   - From the second equation:\n     \\[\n     9 = 2.4s + 4.8 - \\frac{st}{60} - \\frac{2t}{60}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     9 = 2.4s + 4.8 - \\frac{st + 2t}{60}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     4.2 = 2.4s - \\frac{st + 2t}{60}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     252 = 144s - st - 2t \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:**\n   - Substitute \\(st = 240s - 540\\) into Equation 2:\n     \\[\n     252 = 144s - (240s - 540) - 2t\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     252 = 144s - 240s + 540 - 2t\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     252 = -96s + 540 - 2t\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     96s - 2t = 288\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     48s - t = 144 \\quad \\text{(Equation 3)}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\(s\\) and \\(t\\):**\n   - From Equation 3, we can express \\(t\\) in terms of \\(s\\):\n     \\[\n     t = 48s - 144\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\(t = 48s - 144\\) into Equation 1:\n     \\[\n     s(48s - 144) = 240s - 540\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     48s^2 - 144s = 240s - 540\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     48s^2 - 384s + 540 = 0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     2s^2 - 16s + 22.5 = 0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     4s^2 - 32s + 45 = 0\n     \\]\n   - Solve the quadratic equation:\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{32 \\pm \\sqrt{32^2 - 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 45}}{2 \\cdot 4} = \\frac{32 \\pm \\sqrt{1024 - 720}}{8} = \\frac{32 \\pm \\sqrt{304}}{8} = \\frac{32 \\pm 4\\sqrt{19}}{8} = 4 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{19}}{2}\n     \\]\n   - Since \\(s\\) must be a reasonable walking speed, we take the positive root:\n     \\[\n     s = 4 + \\frac{\\sqrt{19}}{2}\n     \\]\n   - Substitute \\(s\\) back into the equation for \\(t\\):\n     \\[\n     t = 48 \\left(4 + \\frac{\\sqrt{19}}{2}\\right) - 144 = 192 + 24\\sqrt{19} - 144 = 48 + 24\\sqrt{19}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Find the walking time at \\(s + \\frac{1}{2}\\) km/h:**\n   - The walking time is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = \\frac{9}{s + \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{9}{4 + \\frac{\\sqrt{19}}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{9}{4.5 + \\frac{\\sqrt{19}}{2}} = \\frac{9}{\\frac{9 + \\sqrt{19}}{2}} = \\frac{18}{9 + \\sqrt{19}}\n     \\]\n   - Rationalize the denominator:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = \\frac{18(9 - \\sqrt{19})}{(9 + \\sqrt{19})(9 - \\sqrt{19})} = \\frac{18(9 - \\sqrt{19})}{81 - 19} = \\frac{18(9 - \\sqrt{19})}{62} = \\frac{9(9 - \\sqrt{19})}{31}\n     \\]\n   - Convert the time to minutes:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = \\frac{9(9 - \\sqrt{19})}{31} \\times 60 \\approx 54 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{54}\\).\n\n### Round 2\n– reward 0\n<BLANK>"}
