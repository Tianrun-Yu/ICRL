{"prompt": "You are an AI mathematician. All content you output **must be in English**.\nBelow are compressed solution ideas from previous attempts; each idea is tagged with reward 1 (correct) or reward 0 (incorrect). Use the question and these ideas to deduce the correct numeric answer. Do **not** show any code or nonâ€‘English text. Respond with exactly one number.\n\nThere exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\\log_x\\left(y^x\\right)=\\log_y\\left(x^{4y}\\right)=10$. Find $xy$.\n\nbad answer reward=0{\n}\ngood answer reward=1{\n}"}
