When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.\n\n### Round 1\nâ€“ reward 1\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Aya to walk 9 kilometers at a speed of \\( s + \\frac{1}{2} \\) kilometers per hour, including the \\( t \\) minutes spent in the coffee shop.\n\nFirst, let's find the value of \\( s \\). We know that when Aya walks at a speed of \\( s \\) kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including \\( t \\) minutes spent in the coffee shop. This means the actual walking time is \\( 4 - \\frac{t}{60} \\) hours. Since the distance is 9 kilometers, we can write the equation:\n\\[ 9 = s \\left( 4 - \\frac{t}{60} \\right) \\]\n\nSimilarly, when Aya walks at a speed of \\( s + 2 \\) kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including \\( t \\) minutes spent in the coffee shop. This means the actual walking time is \\( 2 + \\frac{24}{60} - \\frac{t}{60} = 2.4 - \\frac{t}{60} \\) hours. We can write the equation:\n\\[ 9 = (s + 2) \\left( 2.4 - \\frac{t}{60} \\right) \\]\n\nWe now have two equations:\n1. \\( 9 = s \\left( 4 - \\frac{t}{60} \\right) \\)\n2. \\( 9 = (s + 2) \\left( 2.4 - \\frac{t}{60} \\right) \\)\n\nWe can solve these equations to find \\( s \\) and \\( t \\). Let's start by solving the first equation for \\( t \\):\n\\[ t = 60 \\left( 4s - 9 \\right) / s \\]\n\nNext, we substitute this expression for \\( t \\) into the second equation and solve for \\( s \\):\n\\[ 9 = (s + 2) \\left( 2.4 - \\frac{60 (4s - 9)}{60s} \\right) \\]\n\\[ 9 = (s + 2) \\left( 2.4 - \\frac{4s - 9}{s} \\right) \\]\n\\[ 9 = (s + 2) \\left( 2.4 - 4 + \\frac{9}{s} \\right) \\]\n\\[ 9 = (s + 2) \\left( -1.6 + \\frac{9}{s} \\right) \\]\n\\[ 9 = -1.6s - 3.2 + 9 + \\frac{18}{s} \\]\n\\[ 9 = 5.8 - 1.6s + \\frac{18}{s} \\]\n\\[ 3.2 = -1.6s + \\frac{18}{s} \\]\n\\[ 3.2s = -1.6s^2 + 18 \\]\n\\[ 1.6s^2 + 3.2s - 18 = 0 \\]\n\\[ s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 \\]\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\( s = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = 2 \\), and \\( c = -11.25 \\):\n\\[ s = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} \\]\n\\[ s = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{49}}{2} \\]\n\\[ s = \\frac{-2 \\pm 7}{2} \\]\n\\[ s = \\frac{5}{2} \\text{ or } s = -\\frac{9}{2} \\]\n\nSince \\( s \\) must be positive, we have \\( s = \\frac{5}{2} \\). Now we can find \\( t \\):\n\\[ t = 60 \\left( 4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{2} - 9 \\right) / \\frac{5}{2} \\]\n\\[ t = 60 \\left( 10 - 9 \\right) / \\frac{5}{2} \\]\n\\[ t = 60 \\cdot 1 / \\frac{5}{2} \\]\n\\[ t = 60 \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} \\]\n\\[ t = 24 \\]\n\nNow we know \\( s = \\frac{5}{2} \\) and \\( t = 24 \\). We need to find the time it takes for Aya to walk 9 kilometers at a speed of \\( s + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 3 \\) kilometers per hour, including the 24 minutes spent in the coffee shop. The walking time is:\n\\[ \\text{Walking time} = \\frac{9}{3} = 3 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total time} = 3 \\text{ hours} + \\frac{24}{60} \\text{ hours} = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total time in minutes} = 3.4 \\times 60 = 204 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{204} \\]\n\nLet's verify this with Python code to ensure accuracy.\n```python\n# Given values\ndistance = 9  # kilometers\ns = 5 / 2  # speed in km/h\nt = 24  # time spent in coffee shop in minutes\n\n# Speed for the new walk\nnew_speed = s + 0.5  # km/h\n\n# Walking time at the new speed\nwalking_time_new = distance / new_speed  # hours\n\n# Total time including the coffee shop time\ntotal_time_new = walking_time_new + (t / 60)  # hours\n\n# Convert total time to minutes\ntotal_time_new_minutes = total_time_new * 60  # minutes\n\nprint(total_time_new_minutes)\n```"}
