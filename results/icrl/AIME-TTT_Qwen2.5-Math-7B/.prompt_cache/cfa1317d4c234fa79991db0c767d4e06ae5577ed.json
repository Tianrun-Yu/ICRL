Find $xy$.\n\n### Round 1\n– reward 1- To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) that satisfy the given equations \\(\\log_x(y^x) = 10\\) and \\(\\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\\).\n\nLet's start by rewriting the logarithmic equations in exponential form.\n\n1. From \\(\\log_x(y^x) = 10\\), we get:\n\\[ y^x = x^{10} \\]\n\n2. From \\(\\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\\), we get:\n\\[ x^{4y} = y^{10} \\]\n\nNow we have the following system of equations:\n\\[ y^x = x^{10} \\]\n\\[ x^{4y} = y^{10} \\]\n\nTo solve these equations, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation to simplify them.\n\n1. Taking the natural logarithm of \\(y^x = x^{10}\\):\n\\[ x \\ln(y) = 10 \\ln(x) \\]\n\n2. Taking the natural logarithm of \\(x^{4y} = y^{10}\\):\n\\[ 4y \\ln(x) = 10 \\ln(y) \\]\n\nWe now have the following system of linear equations in terms of \\(\\ln(x)\\) and \\(\\ln(y)\\):\n\\[ x \\ln(y) = 10 \\ln(x) \\]\n\\[ 4y \\ln(x) = 10 \\ln(y) \\]\n\nLet's solve these equations step-by-step. We can express \\(\\ln(y)\\) in terms of \\(\\ln(x)\\) from the first equation:\n\\[ \\ln(y) = \\frac{10 \\ln(x)}{x} \\]\n\nNow substitute this expression for \\(\\ln(y)\\) into the second equation:\n\\[ 4y \\ln(x) = 10 \\left(\\frac{10 \\ln(x)}{x}\\right) \\]\n\\[ 4y \\ln(x) = \\frac{100 \\ln(x)}{x} \\]\n\\[ 4xy \\ln(x) = 100 \\ln(x) \\]\n\nSince \\(\\ln(x) \\neq 0\\) (because \\(x > 1\\)), we can divide both sides by \\(\\ln(x)\\):\n\\[ 4xy = 100 \\]\n\\[ xy = 25 \\]\n\nSo the value of \\(xy\\) is \\(25\\). Let's verify this solution by checking if it satisfies the original equations.\n\nWe can use Python to verify the solution.\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\nx, y = sp.symbols('x y')\n\n# Define the equations\neq1 = sp.Eq(y**x, x**10)\neq2 = sp.Eq(x**(4*y), y**10)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = sp.solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))\nprint(solution)\n```\n```output\ntimeout_decorator.timeout_decorator.TimeoutError: 'Timed Out'\n```\nIt seems that solving the system of equations symbolically is computationally intensive and may not be feasible within a reasonable time frame. However, we can verify our solution by substituting \\(xy = 25\\) back into the original equations and checking if they hold true.\n\nLet's assume \\(x = 5\\) and \\(y = 5\\), since \\(xy = 25\\) and both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are greater than 1. We'll substitute these values into the original equations to verify.\n\n1. For \\(\\log_x(y^x) = 10\\):\n\\[ \\log_5(5^5) = \\log_5(3125) = 5 \\neq 10 \\]\n\nThis shows that \\(x = 5\\) and \\(y = 5\\) do not satisfy the first equation. However, we can try other values that satisfy \\(xy = 25\\). Let's try \\(x = 5\\) and \\(y = 5\\sqrt{5}\\), or vice versa.\n\nLet's substitute \\(x = 5\\) and \\(y = 5\\sqrt{5}\\) into the equations.\n\n1. For \\(\\log_x(y^x) = 10\\):\n\\[ \\log_5((5\\sqrt{5})^5) = \\log_5(5^5 \\cdot (\\sqrt{5})^5) = \\log_5(5^5 \\cdot 5^{5/2}) = \\log_5(5^{15/2}) = \\frac{15}{2} \\neq 10 \\]\n\nThis also does not satisfy the first equation. Let's try another approach. We know that \\(xy = 25\\), so let's express \\(y\\) in terms of \\(x\\):\n\\[ y = \\frac{25}{x} \\]\n\nSubstitute \\(y = \\frac{25}{x}\\) into the first equation:\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{25}{x}\\right)^x = x^{10} \\]\n\\[ 25^x = x^{10} \\cdot x^x \\]\n\\[ 25^x = x^{10+x} \\]\n\\[ (5^2)^x = x^{10+x} \\]\n\\[ 5^{2x} = x^{10+x} \\]\n\nThis equation is difficult to solve symbolically, but we can check if there are any integer solutions. Let's try \\(x = 5\\):\n\\[ 5^{2 \\cdot 5} = 5^{10} \\]\n\\[ 5^{10} = 5^{10} \\]\n\nThis satisfies the first equation. Now let's check the second equation with \\(x = 5\\) and \\(y = 5\\):\n\\[ 5^{4 \\cdot 5} = 5^{10} \\]\n\\[ 5^{20} = 5^{10} \\]\n\nThis does not satisfy the second equation. Let's try another approach. We know that \\(xy = 25\\), so let's express \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\):\n\\[ x = \\frac{25}{y} \\]\n\nSubstitute \\(x = \\frac{25}{y}\\) into the second equation:\n\\[ \\left(\\frac{25}{y}\\right)^{4y} = y^{10} \\]\n\\[ 25^{4y} = y^{10} \\cdot y^{4y} \\]\n\\[ 25^{4y} = y^{10+4y} \\]\n\\[ (5^2)^{4y} = y^{10+4y} \\]\n\\[ 5^{8y} = y^{10+4y} \\]\n\nThis equation is also difficult to solve symbolically, but we can check if there are any integer solutions. Let's try \\(y = 5\\):\n\\[ 5^{8 \\cdot 5} = 5^{10} \\]\n\\[ 5^{40} = 5^{10} \\]\n\nThis does not satisfy the second equation. However, we can try \\(x = 5\\) and \\(y = 5\\sqrt{5}\\) or vice versa. Let's try \\(x = 5\\sqrt{5}\\) and \\(y = 5\\):\n\\[ (5\\sqrt{5})^{4 \\cdot 5} = 5^{10} \\]\n\\[ (5\\sqrt{5})^{20} = 5^{10} \\]\n\\[ 5^{20} \\cdot (\\sqrt{5})^{20} = 5^{10} \\]\n\\[ 5^{20} \\cdot 5^{10} = 5^{10} \\]\n\\[ 5^{30} = 5^{10} \\]\n\nThis does not satisfy the second equation.
