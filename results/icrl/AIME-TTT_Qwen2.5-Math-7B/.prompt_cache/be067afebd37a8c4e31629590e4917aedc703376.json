When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.\n\n### Round 1\nâ€“ reward 1\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the value of \\( s \\) and \\( t \\) first. We can use the information given in the problem to set up equations.\n\n1. When Aya walks at a speed of \\( s \\) km/h, the total time taken for the walk and the coffee shop visit is 4 hours. The time taken to walk 9 km at speed \\( s \\) is \\( \\frac{9}{s} \\) hours. Therefore, the equation for this scenario is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{s} + \\frac{t}{60} = 4\n   \\]\n   where \\( t \\) is in minutes.\n\n2. When Aya walks at a speed of \\( s + 2 \\) km/h, the total time taken for the walk and the coffee shop visit is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is \\( 2 + \\frac{24}{60} = 2.4 \\) hours. The time taken to walk 9 km at speed \\( s + 2 \\) is \\( \\frac{9}{s + 2} \\) hours. Therefore, the equation for this scenario is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{s + 2} + \\frac{t}{60} = 2.4\n   \\]\n\nWe now have two equations:\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{s} + \\frac{t}{60} = 4 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{s + 2} + \\frac{t}{60} = 2.4 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n\\]\n\nWe can solve these equations to find \\( s \\) and \\( t \\).\n\nFirst, we can isolate \\( \\frac{t}{60} \\) in both equations:\n\\[\n\\frac{t}{60} = 4 - \\frac{9}{s} \\quad \\text{(Equation 3)}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{t}{60} = 2.4 - \\frac{9}{s + 2} \\quad \\text{(Equation 4)}\n\\]\n\nSince both expressions equal \\( \\frac{t}{60} \\), we can set them equal to each other:\n\\[\n4 - \\frac{9}{s} = 2.4 - \\frac{9}{s + 2}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\\[\n4 - 2.4 = \\frac{9}{s} - \\frac{9}{s + 2}\n\\]\n\\[\n1.6 = 9 \\left( \\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{1}{s + 2} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n1.6 = 9 \\left( \\frac{(s + 2) - s}{s(s + 2)} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n1.6 = 9 \\left( \\frac{2}{s(s + 2)} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n1.6 = \\frac{18}{s(s + 2)}\n\\]\n\\[\n1.6 s(s + 2) = 18\n\\]\n\\[\n1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s - 18 = 0\n\\]\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation for \\( s \\) using the quadratic formula \\( s = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 1.6 \\), \\( b = 3.2 \\), and \\( c = -18 \\).\n\nLet's calculate the value of \\( s \\).\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coefficients of the quadratic equation\na = 1.6\nb = 3.2\nc = -18\n\n# Calculate the discriminant\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\n\n# Calculate the two possible solutions for s\ns1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\ns2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n\nprint((s1, s2))\n```\n```output\n(2.5, -4.5)\n```\nThe quadratic equation \\(1.6s^2 + 3.2s - 18 = 0\\) has two solutions: \\(s = 2.5\\) and \\(s = -4.5\\). Since speed cannot be negative, we have \\(s = 2.5\\) km/h.\n\nNow we can substitute \\(s = 2.5\\) back into Equation 3 to find \\(t\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{t}{60} = 4 - \\frac{9}{2.5} = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4\n\\]\n\\[\nt = 0.4 \\times 60 = 24 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow we need to find the time taken for the walk when Aya walks at \\(s + \\frac{1}{2} = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3\\) km/h. The time taken to walk 9 km at 3 km/h is:\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{3} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nIncluding the 24 minutes spent in the coffee shop, the total time is:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ hours} + 24 \\text{ minutes} = 3 \\times 60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the \\(t\\) minutes spent in the coffee shop, is \\(\\boxed{204}\\)."}
