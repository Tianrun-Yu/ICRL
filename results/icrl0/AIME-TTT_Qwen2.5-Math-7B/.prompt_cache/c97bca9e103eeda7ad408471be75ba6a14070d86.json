When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.\n\n### Round 1\n- To solve this problem, we need to find the values of $s$ and $t$ first. We know that Aya walks 9 kilometers in 4 hours when her speed is $s$ kilometers per hour, and 9 kilometers in 2 hours and 24 minutes (which is 2.4 hours) when her speed is $s+2$ kilometers per hour. We can set up two equations based on this information:\n\n1. When Aya walks at $s$ kilometers per hour, the time spent walking is 4 hours minus the time spent in the coffee shop. Since the total time is 4 hours, and she spends $t$ minutes in the coffee shop, the time spent walking is $4 - \\frac{t}{60}$ hours. Therefore, we have:\n\\[9 = s \\left(4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\right)\\]\n\n2. When Aya walks at $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the time spent walking is 2.4 hours minus the time spent in the coffee shop. Therefore, we have:\n\\[9 = (s+2) \\left(2.4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\right)\\]\n\nWe can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of $s$ and $t$. After solving, we find that $s = 3$ kilometers per hour and $t = 12$ minutes. \n\nNow, we need to find the number of minutes the walk takes Aya when she walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. We can use the formula for time, which is distance divided by speed. The distance is 9 kilometers, and the speed is $s+\\frac{1}{2} = 3+\\frac{1}{2} = 3.5$ kilometers per hour. Therefore, the time spent walking is $\\frac{9}{3.5}$ hours. We can convert this to minutes by multiplying by 60, and then add the time spent in the coffee shop, which is 12 minutes. Therefore, the total time is:\n\\[\\frac{9}{3.5} \\times 60 + 12 = 154.2857 + 12 = 166.2857\\]\n\nRounding to the nearest minute, we find that the walk takes Aya approximately 166 minutes when she walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour.  – reward 0\n\n### Round 2\n- ### Round 2\n- To solve this problem, we need to find the values of $s$ and $t$ first.
