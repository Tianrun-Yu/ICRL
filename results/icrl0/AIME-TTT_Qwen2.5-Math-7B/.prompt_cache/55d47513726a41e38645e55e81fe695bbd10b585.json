When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.\n\n### Round 1\nâ€“ reward 1\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the values of \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) first. We can use the information given to set up a system of equations.\n\n1. When Aya walks at a speed of \\(s\\) km/h, the total time (including the time spent in the coffee shop) is 4 hours. The walking time is \\(\\frac{9}{s}\\) hours, so the time spent in the coffee shop is \\(4 - \\frac{9}{s}\\) hours, which is \\(t\\) minutes or \\(\\frac{t}{60}\\) hours. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   4 - \\frac{9}{s} = \\frac{t}{60}\n   \\]\n   or equivalently,\n   \\[\n   240 - \\frac{540}{s} = t \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n   \\]\n\n2. When Aya walks at a speed of \\(s+2\\) km/h, the total time (including the time spent in the coffee shop) is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours. The walking time is \\(\\frac{9}{s+2}\\) hours, so the time spent in the coffee shop is \\(2.4 - \\frac{9}{s+2}\\) hours, which is \\(t\\) minutes or \\(\\frac{t}{60}\\) hours. Therefore, we have:\n   \\[\n   2.4 - \\frac{9}{s+2} = \\frac{t}{60}\n   \\]\n   or equivalently,\n   \\[\n   144 - \\frac{540}{s+2} = t \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\n\nNow we can solve these two equations to find \\(s\\) and \\(t\\).\n\nFirst, we equate the two expressions for \\(t\\):\n\\[\n240 - \\frac{540}{s} = 144 - \\frac{540}{s+2}\n\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\n96 = \\frac{540}{s} - \\frac{540}{s+2}\n\\]\n\\[\n96 = 540 \\left( \\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{1}{s+2} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n96 = 540 \\left( \\frac{s+2 - s}{s(s+2)} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n96 = 540 \\left( \\frac{2}{s(s+2)} \\right)\n\\]\n\\[\n96 = \\frac{1080}{s(s+2)}\n\\]\n\\[\n96 s(s+2) = 1080\n\\]\n\\[\ns(s+2) = \\frac{1080}{96} = 11.25\n\\]\n\\[\ns^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0\n\\]\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\(s = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 2\\), and \\(c = -11.25\\):\n\\[\ns = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{49}}{2} = \\frac{-2 \\pm 7}{2}\n\\]\nThe solutions are \\(s = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\\) and \\(s = -\\frac{9}{2} = -4.5\\). Since \\(s\\) must be positive, we have \\(s = 2.5\\).\n\nNow we substitute \\(s = 2.5\\) into Equation 1 to find \\(t\\):\n\\[\n240 - \\frac{540}{2.5} = t\n\\]\n\\[\n240 - 216 = t\n\\]\n\\[\nt = 24\n\\]\n\nNow we need to find the time it takes for Aya to walk at a speed of \\(s + \\frac{1}{2} = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3\\) km/h. The walking time is \\(\\frac{9}{3} = 3\\) hours, and the total time including the time spent in the coffee shop is \\(3 + \\frac{24}{60} = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4\\) hours, which is 204 minutes.\n\nSo the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{204}\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this with Python code to ensure the accuracy.\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\r\n\r\n# Define the variables\r\ns, t = symbols('s t')\r\n\r\n# Define the equations based on the problem statement\r\neq1 = Eq(240 - 540/s, t)\r\neq2 = Eq(144 - 540/(s + 2), t)\r\n\r\n# Solve the system of equations\r\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (s, t))\r\ns_val = solution[s]\r\nt_val = solution[t]\r\n\r\n# Calculate the time for the new speed\r\nnew_speed = s_val + 0.5\r\nwalking_time = 9 / new_speed\r\ntotal_time_minutes = (walking_time + t_val / 60) * 60\r\n\r\nprint((s_val, t_val, total_time_minutes.evalf()))\n```"}
