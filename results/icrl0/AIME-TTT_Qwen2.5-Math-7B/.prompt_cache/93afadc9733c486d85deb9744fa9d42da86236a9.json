When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.\n\n### Round 1\nâ€“ reward 1\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the value of \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) first. We know the following:\n\n1. When Aya walks at \\(s\\) km/h, the total time including the coffee shop is 4 hours.\n2. When Aya walks at \\(s+2\\) km/h, the total time including the coffee shop is 2 hours and 24 minutes (which is 2.4 hours).\n\nLet's denote the time spent walking as \\(T_1\\) and \\(T_2\\) for the first and second scenarios respectively. The time spent in the coffee shop is \\(t\\) in both cases. So we have:\n\n\\[ T_1 + t = 4 \\]\n\\[ T_2 + t = 2.4 \\]\n\nThe walking distances are the same in both cases, so we can write:\n\n\\[ s \\cdot T_1 = 9 \\]\n\\[ (s+2) \\cdot T_2 = 9 \\]\n\nFrom the first equation, we get:\n\n\\[ T_1 = \\frac{9}{s} \\]\n\nFrom the second equation, we get:\n\n\\[ T_2 = \\frac{9}{s+2} \\]\n\nSubstituting these into the time equations, we get:\n\n\\[ \\frac{9}{s} + t = 4 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{9}{s+2} + t = 2.4 \\]\n\nWe can solve these equations to find \\(s\\) and \\(t\\). Let's subtract the second equation from the first:\n\n\\[ \\frac{9}{s} - \\frac{9}{s+2} = 1.6 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 9 \\left( \\frac{1}{s} - \\frac{1}{s+2} \\right) = 1.6 \\]\n\\[ 9 \\left( \\frac{(s+2) - s}{s(s+2)} \\right) = 1.6 \\]\n\\[ 9 \\left( \\frac{2}{s(s+2)} \\right) = 1.6 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{18}{s(s+2)} = 1.6 \\]\n\\[ 18 = 1.6s(s+2) \\]\n\\[ 18 = 1.6s^2 + 3.2s \\]\n\\[ 1.6s^2 + 3.2s - 18 = 0 \\]\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\(s = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 1.6\\), \\(b = 3.2\\), and \\(c = -18\\).\n\nLet's calculate the roots of the quadratic equation.\npython\nimport math\n\n# Coefficients of the quadratic equation\na = 1.6\nb = 3.2\nc = -18\n\n# Calculate the discriminant\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\n\n# Calculate the two solutions\ns1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\ns2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n\nprint((s1, s2))\noutput\n(2.5, -4.5)\nThe solutions to the quadratic equation are \\(s = 2.5\\) and \\(s = -4.5\\). Since speed cannot be negative, we have \\(s = 2.5\\) km/h.\n\nNow we can find \\(t\\) using the equation \\(\\frac{9}{s} + t = 4\\):\n\n\\[ \\frac{9}{2.5} + t = 4 \\]\n\\[ 3.6 + t = 4 \\]\n\\[ t = 0.4 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\\[ t = 0.4 \\times 60 = 24 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nNow we need to find the time it takes for Aya to walk at \\(s + \\frac{1}{2} = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3\\) km/h, including the 24 minutes spent in the coffee shop. The time spent walking at 3 km/h is:\n\n\\[ T = \\frac{9}{3} = 3 \\text{ hours} \\]\n\nSo the total time including the coffee shop is:\n\n\\[ 3 \\text{ hours} + 24 \\text{ minutes} = 3 \\times 60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nThus, the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the 24 minutes spent in the coffee shop, is \\(\\boxed{204}\\)."}
