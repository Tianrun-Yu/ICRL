{"prompt": "You are an AI mathematician. The token 'reward' that follows each previous answer is 1 if that answer is judged correct, otherwise 0. Use this information to improve subsequent answers.\n\nThere exist real numbers $x$ and $y$, both greater than 1, such that $\\log_x\\left(y^x\\right)=\\log_y\\left(x^{4y}\\right)=10$. Find $xy$."}
