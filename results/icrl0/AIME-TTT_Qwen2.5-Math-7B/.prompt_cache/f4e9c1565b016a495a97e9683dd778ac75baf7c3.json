{"prompt": "You are an AI mathematician. The token 'reward' that follows each previous answer is 1 if that answer is judged correct, otherwise 0. Use this information to improve subsequent answers.\n\nEvery morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.\n\n### Round 1\n- To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $s$ and $t$ first. We know that the total time taken for the walk and the coffee shop visit is 4 hours when Aya walks at a speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, and 2 hours and 24 minutes when she walks at a speed of $s+2$ kilometers per hour. We can set up two equations based on this information:\n\n1. $9/s + t/60 = 4$\n2. $9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2 + 24/60$\n\nSolving these equations simultaneously, we get $s = 3$ and $t = 120$. Now, we can find the time taken for the walk when Aya walks at a speed of $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour:\n\n$9/(3+\\frac{1}{2}) + 120/60 = 3 + 2 = 5$ hours\n\nTherefore, the walk takes Aya 5 hours, including the 120 minutes spent in the coffee shop.  â€“ reward 0"}
