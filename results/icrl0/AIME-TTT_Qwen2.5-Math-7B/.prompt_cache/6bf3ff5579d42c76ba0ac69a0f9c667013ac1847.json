When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.\n\n### Round 1\n– reward 1\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes for Aya to walk 9 kilometers at a speed of \\(s + \\frac{1}{2}\\) kilometers per hour, including the \\(t\\) minutes spent in the coffee shop.\n\nFirst, let's set up the equations based on the given information:\n\n1. When Aya walks at a speed of \\(s\\) kilometers per hour, the total time (including the coffee shop time) is 4 hours. So, the walking time is \\(4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\) hours. Since the distance is 9 kilometers, we have:\n   \\[\n   s \\left(4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\right) = 9\n   \\]\n\n2. When Aya walks at a speed of \\(s + 2\\) kilometers per hour, the total time (including the coffee shop time) is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours. So, the walking time is \\(2.4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\) hours. Since the distance is 9 kilometers, we have:\n   \\[\n   (s + 2) \\left(2.4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\right) = 9\n   \\]\n\nWe need to solve these two equations to find \\(s\\) and \\(t\\). Let's start by solving the equations.\n\nFirst, we express \\(t\\) from the first equation:\n\\[\ns \\left(4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\right) = 9 \\implies 4s - \\frac{st}{60} = 9 \\implies \\frac{st}{60} = 4s - 9 \\implies t = \\frac{60(4s - 9)}{s}\n\\]\n\nNext, we substitute \\(t\\) into the second equation:\n\\[\n(s + 2) \\left(2.4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\right) = 9 \\implies (s + 2) \\left(2.4 - \\frac{60(4s - 9)}{60s}\\right) = 9 \\implies (s + 2) \\left(2.4 - \\frac{4s - 9}{s}\\right) = 9\n\\]\n\\[\n(s + 2) \\left(2.4 - 4 + \\frac{9}{s}\\right) = 9 \\implies (s + 2) \\left(-1.6 + \\frac{9}{s}\\right) = 9 \\implies (s + 2) \\left(\\frac{-1.6s + 9}{s}\\right) = 9\n\\]\n\\[\n(s + 2) (-1.6s + 9) = 9s \\implies -1.6s^2 + 9s - 3.2s + 18 = 9s \\implies -1.6s^2 - 3.2s + 18 = 0 \\implies 1.6s^2 + 3.2s - 18 = 0\n\\]\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\(s = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 1.6\\), \\(b = 3.2\\), and \\(c = -18\\).\n\nLet's calculate the solutions for \\(s\\).\n\n\nThe solutions to the quadratic equation are \\(s = 2.5\\) and \\(s = -4.5\\). Since speed cannot be negative, we have \\(s = 2.5\\) kilometers per hour.\n\nNow, we can find \\(t\\) using the equation \\(t = \\frac{60(4s - 9)}{s}\\):\n\\[\nt = \\frac{60(4 \\cdot 2.5 - 9)}{2.5} = \\frac{60(10 - 9)}{2.5} = \\frac{60 \\cdot 1}{2.5} = \\frac{60}{2.5} = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(t = 24\\) minutes. Now, we need to find the time it takes for Aya to walk 9 kilometers at a speed of \\(s + \\frac{1}{2} = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3\\) kilometers per hour, including the 24 minutes spent in the coffee shop. The walking time is:\n\\[\n\\text{walking time} = \\frac{9}{3} = 3 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nIncluding the 24 minutes spent in the coffee shop, the total time is:\n\\[\n3 \\text{ hours} + 24 \\text{ minutes} = 180 \\text{ minutes} + 24 \\text{ minutes} = 204 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the \\(t\\) minutes spent in the coffee shop, is \\(\\boxed{204}\\).\n\n### Round 2\n– reward 1"}
