{"prompt": "You are an AI mathematician. The token 'reward' that follows each previous answer is 1 if that answer is judged correct, otherwise 0. Using the question together with the previous answers and their rewards, reason out the correct answer. Absolutely **do not** output ANY programming code or code blocks. For ease of verification, finish your response with exactly one number; that number is the answer to the problem. Use this information to improve subsequent answers.\n\nEvery morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.\n\n### Round 1\nâ€“ reward 0\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the value of $s$ and $t$ first. We can use the information given in the problem to set up a system of equations.\n\nWhen Aya walks at a speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. This means that the time spent walking is $4 - \\frac{t}{60}$ hours. We can use the formula $distance = speed \\times time$ to set up the equation:\n\n$$9 = s \\times (4 - \\frac{t}{60})$$\n\nWhen Aya walks at a speed of $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. This means that the time spent walking is $2 + \\frac{24}{60} - \\frac{t}{60}$ hours. We can use the formula $distance = speed \\times time$ to set up the equation:\n\n$$9 = (s+2) \\times (2 + \\frac{24}{60} - \\frac{t}{60})$$\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two variables:\n\n$$9 = s \\times (4 - \\frac{t}{60})$$\n\n$$9 = (s+2) \\times (2 + \\frac{24}{60} - \\frac{t}{60})$$\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find the values of $s$ and $t$. Once we have the values of $s$ and $t$, we can use the formula $distance = speed \\times time$ to find the number of minutes the walk takes Aya when she walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop."}
