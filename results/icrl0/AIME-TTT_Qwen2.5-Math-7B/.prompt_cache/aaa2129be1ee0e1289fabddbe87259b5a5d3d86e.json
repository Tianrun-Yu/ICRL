{"prompt": "Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.\n\n### Round 1\n- To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) first. We can use the information given to set up a system of equations.\n\n1. When Aya walks at a speed of \\(s\\) km/h, the walk takes her 4 hours including \\(t\\) minutes in the coffee shop. Since she walks 9 km, the time spent walking is \\(4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\) hours. So we have:\n\\[ s \\left(4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\right) = 9 \\]\n\n2. When Aya walks at a speed of \\(s+2\\) km/h, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes including \\(t\\) minutes in the coffee shop. Since she walks 9 km, the time spent walking is \\(2 + \\frac{24}{60} - \\frac{t}{60}\\) hours. So we have:\n\\[ (s+2) \\left(2 + \\frac{24}{60} - \\frac{t}{60}\\right) = 9 \\]\n\nLet's solve these equations step by step.\n\nFirst, let's express the equations in a simplified form:\n\\[ s \\left(4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\right) = 9 \\]\n\\[ (s+2) \\left(2.4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\right) = 9 \\]\n\nWe can solve these equations using Python. Let's do that now.\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\r\n\r\n# Define the variables\r\ns, t = symbols('s t')\r\n\r\n# Define the equations\r\neq1 = Eq(s * (4 - t / 60), 9)\r\neq2 = Eq((s + 2) * (2.4 - t / 60), 9)\r\n\r\n# Solve the system of equations\r\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (s, t))\r\nprint(solution)\n```\n```output\n[(2.50000000000000, 24.0000000000000)]\n```\nThe solution to the system of equations is \\(s = 2.5\\) and \\(t = 24\\).\n\nNow, we need to find out how long it takes Aya to walk 9 km at a speed of \\(s + \\frac{1}{2} = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3\\) km/h, including the 24 minutes spent in the coffee shop.\n\nThe time spent walking is \\( \\frac{9}{3} = 3 \\) hours. Including the 24 minutes spent in the coffee shop, the total time is \\(3\\) hours and \\(24\\) minutes, which is \\(3 \\times 60 + 24 = 204\\) minutes.\n\nSo the final answer is \\(\\boxed{204}\\).  â€“ reward 1"}
