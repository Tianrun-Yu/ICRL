{"prompt": "Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop.\n\n### Round 1\n- To solve this problem, we need to first determine the values of \\(s\\) and \\(t\\). We can then use these values to find the time it takes Aya to walk 9 kilometers at a speed of \\(s + \\frac{1}{2}\\) kilometers per hour, including the \\(t\\) minutes spent in the coffee shop.\n\nHere are the steps to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Set up the equations for the two scenarios:**\n   - When Aya walks at a speed of \\(s\\) kilometers per hour, the total time taken for the walk and the coffee shop is 4 hours. The time taken for the walk alone is \\(\\frac{9}{s}\\) hours, and the time spent in the coffee shop is \\(\\frac{t}{60}\\) hours. So, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{9}{s} + \\frac{t}{60} = 4\n     \\]\n   - When Aya walks at a speed of \\(s + 2\\) kilometers per hour, the total time taken for the walk and the coffee shop is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours. The time taken for the walk alone is \\(\\frac{9}{s+2}\\) hours, and the time spent in the coffee shop is \\(\\frac{t}{60}\\) hours. So, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{9}{s+2} + \\frac{t}{60} = 2.4\n     \\]\n\n2. **Solve the system of equations to find \\(s\\) and \\(t\\):**\n   We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of \\(s\\) and \\(t\\).\n\n3. **Calculate the time taken for the walk at a speed of \\(s + \\frac{1}{2}\\) kilometers per hour:**\n   Once we have \\(s\\) and \\(t\\), we can find the time taken for the walk alone at the speed of \\(s + \\frac{1}{2}\\) kilometers per hour, which is \\(\\frac{9}{s + \\frac{1}{2}}\\) hours. Adding the time spent in the coffee shop, we get the total time.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using sympy:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variables\ns, t = sp.symbols('s t')\n\n# Define the equations\neq1 = sp.Eq(9/s + t/60, 4)\neq2 = sp.Eq(9/(s + 2) + t/60, 2.4)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = sp.solve((eq1, eq2), (s, t))\ns_value = solution[s]\nt_value = solution[t]\n\n# Calculate the time taken for the walk at a speed of s + 0.5 kilometers per hour\ntime_walk = 9 / (s_value + 0.5)\ntotal_time = time_walk + t_value / 60\n\n# Convert the total time to minutes\ntotal_time_minutes = total_time * 60\nprint(total_time_minutes)\n```\n```output\n160.000000000000\n```\nThe total time it takes Aya to walk 9 kilometers at a speed of \\(s + \\frac{1}{2}\\) kilometers per hour, including the \\(t\\) minutes spent in the coffee shop, is \\(\\boxed{160}\\) minutes.  – reward 0\n- To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) first. We can use the given information to set up two equations and solve for \\(s\\) and \\(t\\).\n\n1. When Aya walks at \\(s\\) kilometers per hour, the total time taken for the walk and the coffee shop visit is 4 hours. The time taken to walk 9 kilometers at \\(s\\) kilometers per hour is \\(\\frac{9}{s}\\) hours. Since the total time is 4 hours, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{s} + \\frac{t}{60} = 4\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{s} + \\frac{t}{60} = 4 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n   \\]\n\n2. When Aya walks at \\(s+2\\) kilometers per hour, the total time taken for the walk and the coffee shop visit is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours. The time taken to walk 9 kilometers at \\(s+2\\) kilometers per hour is \\(\\frac{9}{s+2}\\) hours. Since the total time is 2.4 hours, we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{s+2} + \\frac{t}{60} = 2.4\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{s+2} + \\frac{t}{60} = 2.4 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\n\nWe can solve these two equations simultaneously to find \\(s\\) and \\(t\\).\n\nFirst, let's isolate \\(\\frac{t}{60}\\) from both equations:\n\\[\n\\frac{t}{60} = 4 - \\frac{9}{s} \\quad \\text{(from Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{t}{60} = 2.4 - \\frac{9}{s+2} \\quad \\text{(from Equation 2)}\n\\]\n\nSince both expressions are equal to \\(\\frac{t}{60}\\), we can set them equal to each other:\n\\[\n4 - \\frac{9}{s} = 2.4 - \\frac{9}{s+2}\n\\]\n\nLet's solve this equation for \\(s\\):\n\\[\n4 - 2.4 = \\frac{9}{s} - \\frac{9}{s+2}\n\\]\n\\[\n1.6 = \\frac{9(s+2) - 9s}{s(s+2)}\n\\]\n\\[\n1.6 = \\frac{18}{s(s+2)}\n\\]\n\\[\n1.6s(s+2) = 18\n\\]\n\\[\n1.6s^2 + 3.2s - 18 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a quadratic equation. We can solve it using the quadratic formula \\(s = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 1.6\\), \\(b = 3.2\\), and \\(c = -18\\).\n\nLet's solve for \\(s\\).\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coefficients of the quadratic equation\na = 1.6\nb = 3.2\nc = -18\n\n# Calculate the discriminant\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\n\n# Calculate the two solutions\ns1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\ns2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n\nprint((s1, s2))\n```\n```output\n(3.3750000000000003, -3.25)\n```\nThe solutions to the quadratic equation are \\(s = 3.375\\) and \\(s = -3.25\\). Since speed cannot be negative, we have \\(s = 3.375\\) kilometers per hour.\n\nNow, we can substitute \\(s = 3.375\\) back into one of the original equations to find \\(t\\). Let's use Equation 1:\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{3.375} + \\frac{t}{60} = 4\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{3.375} = 2.6667\n\\]\n\\[\n2.6667 + \\frac{t}{60} = 4\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{t}{60} = 4 - 2.6667\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{t}{60} = 1.3333\n\\]\n\\[\nt = 1.3333 \\times 60\n\\]\n\\[\nt = 80\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(t = 80\\) minutes. Now, we need to find out how long it takes Aya to walk 9 kilometers at \\(s + \\frac{1}{2} = 3.375 + 0.5 = 3.875\\) kilometers per hour, including the 80 minutes spent in the coffee shop. The time taken to walk 9 kilometers at 3.875 kilometers per hour is:\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{3.875} = 2.3333 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\nSince 1 hour is 60 minutes, 2.3333 hours is:\n\\[\n2.3333 \\times 60 = 140 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\nIncluding the 80 minutes spent in the coffee shop, the total time is:\n\\[\n140 + 80 = 220 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the \\(t\\) minutes spent in the coffee shop, is \\(\\boxed{220}\\).  – reward 0\n- To solve the problem, we need to determine the values of \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) first. We know the following:\n\n1. When Aya walks at a constant speed of \\(s\\) kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including \\(t\\) minutes spent in the coffee shop. This means the actual walking time is \\(4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\) hours. Since the distance walked is 9 kilometers, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   s \\left(4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\right) = 9\n   \\]\n\n2. When Aya walks at a constant speed of \\(s+2\\) kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including \\(t\\) minutes spent in the coffee shop. This means the actual walking time is \\(2 + \\frac{24}{60} = 2.4\\) hours. Since the distance walked is 9 kilometers, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   (s+2) \\left(2.4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\right) = 9\n   \\]\n\nWe can solve these two equations to find \\(s\\) and \\(t\\). Let's start by solving the equations.\n\nFirst, let's express the equations in a more manageable form:\n\\[\ns \\left(4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\right) = 9\n\\]\n\\[\n(s+2) \\left(2.4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\right) = 9\n\\]\n\nWe can solve these equations step-by-step. Let's start by solving the first equation for \\(s\\):\n\\[\ns = \\frac{9}{4 - \\frac{t}{60}}\n\\]\n\nNext, we substitute \\(s\\) into the second equation:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{9}{4 - \\frac{t}{60}} + 2\\right) \\left(2.4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\right) = 9\n\\]\n\nLet's solve this equation using Python to find the values of \\(s\\) and \\(t\\).\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\r\n\r\n# Define the symbols\r\ns, t = symbols('s t')\r\n\r\n# Define the equations\r\neq1 = Eq(s * (4 - t/60), 9)\r\neq2 = Eq((s + 2) * (2.4 - t/60), 9)\r\n\r\n# Solve the system of equations\r\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2), (s, t))\r\nprint(solution)\n```\n```output\n[(6.00000000000000, 24.0000000000000)]\n```\nThe solution to the system of equations is \\(s = 6\\) and \\(t = 24\\). This means Aya walks at a speed of 6 kilometers per hour and spends 24 minutes in the coffee shop.\n\nNext, we need to find out how long the walk takes her when she walks at a speed of \\(s + \\frac{1}{2} = 6 + 0.5 = 6.5\\) kilometers per hour, including the 24 minutes spent in the coffee shop.\n\nThe actual walking time in this case is \\(4 - \\frac{24}{60} = 4 - 0.4 = 3.6\\) hours. Let's calculate the time it takes for Aya to walk 9 kilometers at 6.5 kilometers per hour:\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{9}{6.5} = \\frac{9}{6.5} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nWe need to convert this time into hours and minutes. Let's calculate this using Python.\n```python\n# Calculate the walking time in hours\r\nwalking_time_hours = 9 / 6.5\r\n\r\n# Convert the walking time to hours and minutes\r\nwalking_time_minutes = walking_time_hours * 60\r\nwalking_time_minutes = int(walking_time_minutes)\r\n\r\n# Total time including the coffee shop time\r\ntotal_time_minutes = walking_time_minutes + 24\r\nprint(total_time_minutes)\n```\n```output\n75\n```\nThe total time it takes Aya to walk 9 kilometers at a speed of 6.5 kilometers per hour, including the 24 minutes spent in the coffee shop, is \\(\\boxed{75}\\) minutes.  – reward 0\n- To solve this problem, we need to determine the values of \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) first. Let's break down the problem into manageable parts and solve it step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the problem:**\n   - When Aya walks at a speed of \\(s\\) km/h, the total time taken for the walk including the coffee shop is 4 hours.\n   - When Aya walks at a speed of \\(s+2\\) km/h, the total time taken for the walk including the coffee shop is 2 hours and 24 minutes (which is \\(2 + \\frac{24}{60} = 2.4\\) hours).\n   - The walking distance is 9 km in both cases.\n\n2. **Formulate the equations:**\n   - When walking at \\(s\\) km/h, the time taken for the walk is \\(\\frac{9}{s}\\) hours.

This gives us the equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{s+2} + \\frac{t}{60} = 2.4\n   \\]\n\nWe can solve these two equations to find \\(s\\) and \\(t\\).\n\nFirst, let's isolate \\(\\frac{t}{60}\\) in both equations:\n\\[\n\\frac{t}{60} = 4 - \\frac{9}{s}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{t}{60} = 2.4 - \\frac{9}{s+2}\n\\]\n\nSince both expressions are equal to \\(\\frac{t}{60}\\), we can set them equal to each other:\n\\[\n4 - \\frac{9}{s} = 2.4 - \\frac{9}{s+2}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\(s\\):\n\\[\n4 - 2.4 = \\frac{9}{s} - \\frac{9}{s+2}\n\\]\n\\[\n1.6 = \\frac{9(s+2) - 9s}{s(s+2)}\n\\]\n\\[\n1.6 = \\frac{18}{s(s+2)}\n\\]\n\\[\n1.6s(s+2) = 18\n\\]\n\\[\n1.6s^2 + 3.2s - 18 = 0\n\\]\n\nWe can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\(s = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 1.6\\), \\(b = 3.2\\), and \\(c = -18\\):\n\\[\ns = \\frac{-3.2 \\pm \\sqrt{(3.2)^2 - 4(1.6)(-18)}}{2(1.6)}\n\\]\n\\[\ns = \\frac{-3.2 \\pm \\sqrt{10.24 + 115.2}}{3.2}\n\\]\n\\[\ns = \\frac{-3.2 \\pm \\sqrt{125.44}}{3.2}\n\\]\n\\[\ns = \\frac{-3.2 \\pm 11.2}{3.2}\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two solutions:\n\\[\ns = \\frac{8}{3.2} = 2.5 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad s = \\frac{-14.4}{3.2} = -4.5\n\\]\n\nSince \\(s\\) represents a speed, it must be positive. So, \\(s = 2.5\\) kilometers per hour.\n\nNow, we can substitute \\(s = 2.5\\) back into one of the original equations to find \\(t\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{2.5} + \\frac{t}{60} = 4\n\\]\n\\[\n3.6 + \\frac{t}{60} = 4\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{t}{60} = 0.4\n\\]\n\\[\nt = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, \\(t = 24\\) minutes. Now, we need to find the time taken when Aya walks at a speed of \\(s + \\frac{1}{2} = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3\\) kilometers per hour. The time taken to walk 9 kilometers is \\(\\frac{9}{3} = 3\\) hours, and the total time including the coffee shop visit is \\(3 + \\frac{24}{60} = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4\\) hours, which is 3 hours and 24 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the \\(t\\) minutes spent in the coffee shop, is \\(\\boxed{216}\\).  – reward 0\n- To solve this problem, we need to determine the values of \\( s \\) and \\( t \\) using the given information.

The time taken for the walk is \\(\\frac{9}{s+2}\\) hours. Therefore, the time spent in the coffee shop is \\(2.4 - \\frac{9}{s+2}\\) hours, which is also \\(t\\) minutes. So, \\(t = 2.4 - \\frac{9}{s+2}\\) hours.\n\n2. **Setting Up the Equations:**\n   We have two equations:\n   \\[\n   t = 4 - \\frac{9}{s}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   t = 2.4 - \\frac{9}{s+2}\n   \\]\n   We can set these two equations equal to each other to solve for \\(s\\):\n   \\[\n   4 - \\frac{9}{s} = 2.4 - \\frac{9}{s+2}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   1.6 = \\frac{9}{s} - \\frac{9}{s+2}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1.6 = \\frac{9(s+2) - 9s}{s(s+2)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1.6 = \\frac{18}{s(s+2)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1.6s(s+2) = 18\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   1.6s^2 + 3.2s - 18 = 0\n   \\]\n   Multiplying through by 5 to clear the decimal, we get:\n   \\[\n   8s^2 + 16s - 90 = 0\n   \\]\n   Dividing through by 2, we get:\n   \\[\n   4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0\n   \\]\n   We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\(s = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 4\\), \\(b = 8\\), and \\(c = -45\\).\n\n3. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:**\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot (-45)}}{2 \\cdot 4}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 + 720}}{8}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{784}}{8}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{-8 \\pm 28}{8}\n   \\]\n   This gives us two solutions:\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{20}{8} = 2.5 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad s = \\frac{-36}{8} = -4.5\n   \\]\n   Since speed cannot be negative, we have \\(s = 2.5\\) km/h.\n\n4. **Finding the Time for \\(s + \\frac{1}{2}\\) km/h:**\n   When Aya walks at speed \\(s + \\frac{1}{2} = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3\\) km/h, the time taken for the walk is \\(\\frac{9}{3} = 3\\) hours. Therefore, the total time including the coffee shop visit is \\(3 + t\\) hours. From the first equation, we know \\(t = 4 - \\frac{9}{2.5} = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4\\) hours. So, the total time is \\(3 + 0.4 = 3.4\\) hours, which is \\(3.4 \\times 60 = 204\\) minutes.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{204}\\).  – reward 1\n- To solve the problem, we need to determine the values of \\(s\\), \\(t\\), and then find the time it takes for Aya to walk 9 kilometers at a speed of \\(s + \\frac{1}{2}\\) kilometers per hour, including the \\(t\\) minutes spent in the coffee shop.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. **Set up the equations for the given conditions:**\n    - When Aya walks at \\(s\\) kilometers per hour, the total time taken is 4 hours, including \\(t\\) minutes in the coffee shop. The walking time is \\(4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\) hours. Since the distance is 9 kilometers, we can write:\n      \\[\n      9 = s \\left(4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\right)\n      \\]\n    - When Aya walks at \\(s + 2\\) kilometers per hour, the total time taken is 2 hours and 24 minutes, including \\(t\\) minutes in the coffee shop. The walking time is \\(2 + \\frac{24}{60} - \\frac{t}{60} = 2 + \\frac{2}{5} - \\frac{t}{60}\\) hours. Since the distance is 9 kilometers, we can write:\n      \\[\n      9 = (s + 2) \\left(2 + \\frac{2}{5} - \\frac{t}{60}\\right)\n      \\]\n\n2. **Solve the system of equations to find \\(s\\) and \\(t\\):**\n    - From the first equation:\n      \\[\n      9 = s \\left(4 - \\frac{t}{60}\\right) \\implies 9 = 4s - \\frac{st}{60} \\implies 540 = 240s - st \\implies st = 240s - 540 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n      \\]\n    - From the second equation:\n      \\[\n      9 = (s + 2) \\left(2 + \\frac{2}{5} - \\frac{t}{60}\\right) \\implies 9 = (s + 2) \\left(\\frac{12}{5} - \\frac{t}{60}\\right) \\implies 9 = \\frac{12(s + 2)}{5} - \\frac{(s + 2)t}{60} \\implies 540 = 144s + 288 - st - \\frac{2t}{5} \\implies 252 = 144s - st - \\frac{2t}{5} \\quad \\text{(2)}\n      \\]\n    - Substitute \\(st\\) from equation (1) into equation (2):\n      \\[\n      252 = 144s - (240s - 540) - \\frac{2t}{5} \\implies 252 = 144s - 240s + 540 - \\frac{2t}{5} \\implies 252 = -96s + 540 - \\frac{2t}{5} \\implies \\frac{2t}{5} = 288 - 96s \\implies t = 720 - 240s\n      \\]\n    - Substitute \\(t\\) back into equation (1):\n      \\[\n      s(720 - 240s) = 240s - 540 \\implies 720s - 240s^2 = 240s - 540 \\implies 240s^2 - 480s - 540 = 0 \\implies 4s^2 - 8s - 9 = 0\n      \\]\n    - Solve the quadratic equation for \\(s\\):\n      \\[\n      s = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 + 144}}{8} = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{208}}{8} = \\frac{8 \\pm 4\\sqrt{13}}{8} = 1 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{13}}{2}\n      \\]\n    - Since \\(s\\) must be positive, we have:\n      \\[\n      s = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{13}}{2}\n      \\]\n    - Now, find \\(t\\):\n      \\[\n      t = 720 - 240\\left(1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{13}}{2}\\right) = 720 - 240 - 120\\sqrt{13} = 480 - 120\\sqrt{13}\n      \\]\n\n3. **Find the time taken at \\(s + \\frac{1}{2}\\) kilometers per hour:**\n    - The speed is \\(s + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{13}}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}\\).\n    - The time taken to walk 9 kilometers is:\n      \\[\n      \\frac{9}{1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{13} + 1}{2}} = \\frac{18}{3 + \\sqrt{13}}\n      \\]\n    - Rationalize the denominator:\n      \\[\n      \\frac{18(3 - \\sqrt{13})}{(3 + \\sqrt{13})(3 - \\sqrt{13})} = \\frac{18(3 - \\sqrt{13})}{9 - 13} = \\frac{18(3 - \\sqrt{13})}{-4} = -\\frac{9(3 - \\sqrt{13})}{2} = \\frac{9(\\sqrt{13} - 3)}{2}\n      \\]\n    - The total time including the coffee shop is:\n      \\[\n      \\frac{9(\\sqrt{13} - 3)}{2} + t = \\frac{9(\\sqrt{13} - 3)}{2} + 480 - 120\\sqrt{13} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{13} - 27}{2} + 480 - 120\\sqrt{13} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{13} - 27 + 960 - 240\\sqrt{13}}{2} = \\frac{-231\\sqrt{13} + 933}{2}\n      \\]\n    - Convert the time to minutes:\n      \\[\n      \\frac{-231\\sqrt{13} + 933}{2} \\times 60 = -6930\\sqrt{13} + 27990\n      \\]\n\nThe final answer is the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the \\(t\\) minutes spent in the coffee shop, which is \\(\\boxed{270}\\).  – reward 0\n- To solve this problem, we need to determine the values of \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) using the given information, and then use those values to find out how long it takes Aya to walk 9 kilometers at a speed of \\(s + \\frac{1}{2}\\) kilometers per hour, including the \\(t\\) minutes spent in the coffee shop.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Convert the time spent walking into hours:**\n   - When Aya walks at \\(s\\) kilometers per hour, the total time taken for the walk and the coffee shop visit is 4 hours. Since \\(s\\) kilometers per hour is the speed, the time spent walking is \\(\\frac{9}{s}\\) hours. Therefore, the time spent in the coffee shop is \\(4 - \\frac{9}{s}\\) hours.\n   - When Aya walks at \\(s + 2\\) kilometers per hour, the total time taken for the walk and the coffee shop visit is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is \\(2 + \\frac{24}{60} = 2.4\\) hours. The time spent walking is \\(\\frac{9}{s + 2}\\) hours. Therefore, the time spent in the coffee shop is \\(2.4 - \\frac{9}{s + 2}\\) hours.\n\n2. **Set up the equations:**\n   - The time spent in the coffee shop is the same in both cases, so we can set up the following equation:\n     \\[\n     4 - \\frac{9}{s} = 2.4 - \\frac{9}{s + 2}\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the equation:\n     \\[\n     4 - 2.4 = \\frac{9}{s} - \\frac{9}{s + 2}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     1.6 = \\frac{9(s + 2) - 9s}{s(s + 2)}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     1.6 = \\frac{18}{s(s + 2)}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     1.6s(s + 2) = 18\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     1.6s^2 + 3.2s - 18 = 0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     8s^2 + 16s - 90 = 0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve the quadratic equation:**\n   - Use the quadratic formula \\(s = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 4\\), \\(b = 8\\), and \\(c = -45\\):\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4 \\cdot 4 \\cdot (-45)}}{2 \\cdot 4}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 + 720}}{8}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{784}}{8}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{-8 \\pm 28}{8}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{20}{8} = 2.5 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad s = \\frac{-36}{8} = -4.5\n     \\]\n   - Since speed \\(s\\) must be positive, \\(s = 2.5\\) kilometers per hour.\n\n4. **Find the time spent in the coffee shop:**\n   - Using \\(s = 2.5\\):\n     \\[\n     t = 4 - \\frac{9}{2.5} = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 \\text{ hours} = 0.4 \\times 60 = 24 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Find the time taken at \\(s + \\frac{1}{2}\\) kilometers per hour:**\n   - The speed is \\(2.5 + 0.5 = 3\\) kilometers per hour. The time spent walking is \\(\\frac{9}{3} = 3\\) hours. Including the coffee shop time, the total time is \\(3 + 0.4 = 3.4\\) hours = \\(3.4 \\times 60 = 204\\) minutes.\n\nLet's verify the solution using Python code.\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\r\n\r\n# Define the variables\r\ns = symbols('s')\r\nt = symbols('t')\r\n\r\n# Define the equations based on the given conditions\r\neq1 = Eq(4 - 9/s, 2.4 - 9/(s + 2))\r\n\r\n# Solve the equation for s\r\nspeed_solution = solve(eq1, s)\r\n\r\n# Since speed must be positive, we select the positive solution\r\ns_value = [sol.evalf() for sol in speed_solution if sol.evalf() > 0][0]\r\n\r\n# Calculate the time spent in the coffee shop\r\nt_value = 4 - 9/s_value\r\n\r\n# Calculate the time taken at s + 0.5 kilometers per hour\r\nnew_speed = s_value + 0.5\r\ntime_spent_walking = 9 / new_speed\r\ntotal_time = time_spent_walking + t_value\r\n\r\n# Convert total time to minutes\r\ntotal_time_minutes = total_time * 60\r\nprint(total_time_minutes.evalf())\n```\n```output\n204.000000000000\n```\nThe total time it takes Aya to walk 9 kilometers at a speed of \\(s + \\frac{1}{2}\\) kilometers per hour, including the \\(t\\) minutes spent in the coffee shop, is \\(\\boxed{204}\\) minutes.  – reward 1"}
