## üìñ Overview

<sub>The AIME24 scores versus training steps of Skywork-OR1-Math-7B in our multi-stage training pipeline.</sub>
</div>

The **`Skywork-OR1`** (Open Reasoner 1) model series consists of powerful math and code reasoning models trained using large-scale rule-based reinforcement learning with carefully designed datasets and training recipes. This series includes two general-purpose reasoning modelsl, **`Skywork-OR1-7B-Preview`** and **`Skywork-OR1-32B-Preview`**, along with a math-specialized model, **`Skywork-OR1-Math-7B`**.

- **[`Skywork-OR1-Math-7B`](https://huggingface.co/Skywork/Skywork-OR1-Math-7B)** is specifically optimized for mathematical reasoning, scoring **69.8** on AIME24 and **52.3** on AIME25 ‚Äî well ahead of all models of similar size.
- **[`Skywork-OR1-32B-Preview`](https://huggingface.co/Skywork/Skywork-OR1-32B-Preview)** delivers the 671B-parameter Deepseek-R1 performance on math tasks (AIME24 and AIME25) and coding tasks (LiveCodeBench).
- **[`Skywork-OR1-7B-Preview`](https://huggingface.co/Skywork/Skywork-OR1-7B-Preview)** outperforms all similarly sized models in both math and coding scenarios.

The final release version will be available in two weeks.

## üìä Evaluation

<div align="center">

</div>
</div>

We evaluate our models on AIME24, AIME25, and LiveCodeBench. Instead of using Pass@1, which is common in prior work, we introduce Avg@K as the primary metric. This metric robustly measures a model's average performance across K independent attempts, reducing the impact of randomness and enhancing the reliability of the results. We believe that Avg@K provides a better reflection of a model's stability and reasoning consistency.

We include the detailed results in the following table.

| Model | AIME24 (Avg@32) | AIME25 (Avg@32) | LiveCodeBench (8/1/24-2/1/25) (Avg@4) |
|-------|---------|---------|--------------|
| DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B | 55.5 | 39.2| 37.6 |
| Light-R1-7B-DS | 59.1 | 44.3| 39.5 |
| DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B | 72.9 | 59.0| 57.2 |
| TinyR1-32B-Preview | 78.1| 65.3| 61.6 |
| QwQ-32B | 79.5 | 65.3| 61.6 |
| DeepSeek-R1 | 79.8 | 70.0| 65.9 |
| **Skywork-OR1-Math-7B** | 69.8 | 52.3 | 43.6 |
| **Skywork-OR1-7B-Preview** | 63.6 | 45.8 | 43.9 |
| **Skywork-OR1-32B-Preview** | 79.7 | 69.0 | 63.9 |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Training Recipe

We offer a brief overview of our data and training pipeline below. For more details, please refer to our Notion Blog [here](https://capricious-hydrogen-41c.notion.site/Skywork-Open-Reaonser-Series-1d0bc9ae823a80459b46c149e4f51680).

### Data

- We select, clean, and curate **a dataset of 110K verifiable, challenging, and diverse math problems and 14K coding questions** from open-source datasets.
- We perform **model-aware difficulty estimation** for each problem and model and conduct **rigorous quality assessment prior to training** to ensure training efficiency and effectiveness.

### Training

We develop a customized version of GRPO that leverages both data-wise and training-wise improvements:

- We perform both **offline and online difficulty-based filtering** and **rejection sampling** to improve training efficiency.
- We incorporate a **multi-stage training pipeline** coupled with **adaptive entropy control** and other techniques to enhance exploration and stability.

## üìÑ Technical Report

Our technical report will be released soon. Stay tuned!

## üôè Acknowledgements

- Both of our models are trained on top of [`DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B`](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) and [`DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B`](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B).
- Both models are trained using [a custom fork](https://github.com/SkyworkAI/Skywork-OR1) of the wonderful [`verl`](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) project.
